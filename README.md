**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable involves following best practices in software development. This includes using clear and consistent naming conventions, writing modular code with well-defined functions and classes, and including comments and documentation to explain complex logic. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, maintainability and readability were achieved by structuring the code into a class with methods corresponding to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. This modular approach not only made the code easier to read and understand but also allowed for easier modifications and extensions in the future. The advantages of this approach were evident when connecting the module to the dashboard widgets in Project Two, as the clear separation of concerns made integration straightforward. This CRUD Python module could be reused in other projects requiring database interactions, ensuring consistency and saving development time.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks and applying logical thinking and systematic analysis. For the database and dashboard requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare, the approach started with understanding the requirements and designing a solution that met those needs. This included defining the necessary database schema, implementing CRUD operations, and creating a user-friendly dashboard interface. Compared to previous assignments, this project required a deeper integration between backend and frontend components, emphasizing the importance of communication between different parts of the system. In the future, I would use techniques like Agile development, iterative testing, and user feedback loops to create databases and applications that meet client requests effectively.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists solve problems using computational methods, develop software and hardware solutions, and contribute to various fields through innovative technology. This work is crucial because it drives advancements in multiple industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. In the context of the Grazioso Salvare project, the work on the CRUD module and dashboard directly supports the company's mission by streamlining their data management processes. Efficient data handling and user-friendly interfaces can significantly enhance the company's operations, enabling them to save more animals and improve their services. By automating routine tasks and providing easy access to critical information, the solutions developed by computer scientists can lead to more effective decision-making and operational efficiency.
